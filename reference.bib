abstract="This paper introduces a new open dataset ``Actions for Cooking Eggs (ACE) Dataset'' and summarizes results of the contest on ``Kitchen Scene Context based Gesture Recognition'', in conjunction with ICPR2012. The dataset consists of naturally performed actions in a kitchen environment. Five kinds of cooking menus were actually performed by five different actors, and the cooking actions were recorded by a Kinect Sensor. Color image sequences and depth image sequences are both available. Besides, action label was given to each frame. To estimate the action label, action recognition method has to analyze not only actor's action, but also scene contexts such as ingredients and cooking utensils. We compare the submitted algorithms and the results in this paper.",
